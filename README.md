# ToiBox | WordPress Starter Theme

ToiBox is a WordPress Starter Theme. Like Automattic's own __s_ it is intended to be hacked rather than child-themed.

The motivation behind this theme came from the desire to build something that:

 - Utilises modern build tools, namely Laravel Mix's Webpack wrapper and extensions
 - Smart transpiling of CSS with Autoprefixer and .browserslistrc
 - Smart transpiling of JS with Babel and .browserslistrc
 - Support for JavaScript written in ES6
 - Automatic creation of PNG sprites from individual PNGs
 - Automatic creation of inline SVG sprites from individual SVGs
 - Automatic extraction and inlining of critical "above the fold" CSS
 - Utilization of the Customizer for theme options etc
 - Clean folder and template organization
 - Wrapper templates rather than `get_header` and `get_footer`
 - Lints and formats all code against WordPress Coding Standards
